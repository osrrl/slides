# Course desecription

### SPAN589: Data Science for Linguistics

In this course students examine the fundamental principles of doing experimental 
research in linguistics. Specifically, the focus is on developing an in depth 
understanding of the experimental paradigms and statistical procedures used in 
sociolinguistics, phonetics, psycholinguistics, syntax, and corpus linguistics. 
Students will learn advanced techniques used to explore, tidy, visualize, and 
analyze data. We will also focus on how to make the aforementioned procedures 
reproducible and shareable. Students will develop a foundation in programming in 
R, as well as learning the most common tools at the disposal of todays data 
scientist (i.e. GitHub, Knitr, etc.). No prior experience with statistics or 
programming is necessary.  
Pre-requisites: SPAN 361 or 363

| - peer review (6%)            |     |     |         |

---

### Preparation and participation

Students are expected to attend class prepared and to actively participate. 
Part of this grade is derived from reading summaries. Students will 
occasionally be required to write a brief summary (max. 1 page) of the weekly 
readings and answer assigned questions. 

---

### Programming assignments

Students will complete 4 programming assignments over the course of the 
semester. These assignments are designed in a way so that the student must 
demonstrate adequate knowledge of basic programming and statistical principles 
covered in class. The skills required in each assignment are cumulative, each 
building on the material learned in the previous weeks. All statistical 
programming assignments must be completed in RMarkdown and will be handed in 
via GitHub unless otherwise noted.

---

### Online presentation

The presentation will be on the statistical analyses used in some published 
paper. This presentation must be hosted on GitHub and in HTML format using 
RMarkdown. Aside from creating an online presentation, students will also be 
required to read and comment on the presentations of two classmates. 

---

### Midterm exam

There will be an in-class exam during the 11th week of the semester (April 
3rd). Details will be provided beforehand. 

---

### Research Project

#### Overview

Each student will complete a research project in which they put in practice 
the tools learned over the course of the semester. The primary focus will be 
on managing the project in an automatic and reproducible way so that it can 
be shared with other collaborators. The project will be hosted on GitHub and 
will include the following:

- slides
- manuscript
- r code
- data (raw and tidy)

---

### Research Project

#### Overview

Students have two options regarding the type of project they do:

1. Personal project (real)
    - For advanced students working on their own data
    - Ideal for QP, thesis, other projects
2. Hypothetical project (simulated)
    - For students w/o data
    - Ideal for students in proposal phase (IRB, NSF, ect.)

All projects require the prior approval of the professor. Project due dates 
will be established in class, but can be expected to be due several days 
before the university assigned final exam (though there is no exam).

---

### Research Project

#### Paper

The manuscript will be a write up of the methods/results sections of a research 
article. The focus is on clearly and accurately explaining the statistical 
analyses used in the project and appropriately interpreting the results. The 
paper must be a literate document written in RMarkdown using ```papaja```. We 
will demo this in class.

#### Presentation

Students will present their work in a semi-finished state during the final 
week of the semester (10 min. presentation + 5 min. for questions). The slides 
of this presentation are part of the project and must also be hosted on GitHub.

---

### Research Project

#### Peer review

Each student is required to evaluate the project of two other students. They 
will fork the project in order to evaluate the reproducibility of the code 
and the statistical validity of the analysis. Students will write up two 
evaluations for each peer: one for the professor (not to be seen by anybody 
else), and one for the owner of the project in the form of an issue/comment on 
GitHub. The evaluation written for the professor should be longer and more in 
depth. Both evaluations should be written in the style of a peer review for an
academic journal, thus they should include comments, questions, suggestions, and 
*constructive* criticisms (\#BeReviewer1). The point of this excersize is to 
help the author make the final product better.

# Department rules and course policy

---

The course is designed to satisfy the learning goals of the Department of 
Spanish and Portuguese. More information available at: http://span-port.rutgers.edu/learning-goals

### Communication

All course communication will be via Slack. You should have received an email 
with an invitation link to join the course Slack. Some rules for using Slack:

- Use an identifiable username and add your picture to your profile.
- Only the professor is allowed to use the @channel and @here mentions.
- While this is an informal communication channel, all rules of academic 
discourse apply.
- Ask and answer questions on the appropriate channel.
- Create channels as needed, especially for study groups.

---

### Attendance

Regular class attendance is essential for successful completion of the course. 
More than 1 absences will have a negative effect on your final grade. The 2nd 
absence and every subsequent absence after that will result in the loss of 5% 
point off the final overall course grade, regardless of reason. Keep in mind 
that while you have 1 "free" absence, on the day/s you miss you will not be able 
to earn participation points, you will miss the material given in class and you 
might miss your own presentation. If you are absent, contact a classmate 
immediately to get the assignments and to keep up with the material scheduled in 
the syllabus. The instructor is not responsible for catching you up. Do not 
send emails to the instructor asking for updates if you missed class.

Any planned absence that you are aware of ahead of time, such as religious 
holidays recognized by Rutgers University or Dean's excuses, should be 
made up before the absence occurs. If you know that you will be absent, it is 
your responsibility to let the instructor know ahead of time. All holidays or 
special events observed by any religion will be honored for those students who 
show affiliation with that particular religion. Absences pre-approved by the RU 
Dean of Students (or Dean's designee) will be honored.

---

### Code of academic integrity

The professor will initiate an academic integrity case against students 
suspected of cheating, plagiarizing, or aiding others in dishonest academic 
behavior. Students are responsible for reading and understanding the Code of 
Academic Integrity.

Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, 
cheating, and aiding and abetting dishonesty. An example of plagiarism would be 
to submit a written sample which in part or in whole is not the student's own 
work without attributing the source. Cheating includes allowing another person 
to do your work and to submit the work under one's own name. Any work which is 
submitted for a grade must be 100% the student's own work. If you are not sure 
when it is appropriate to seek help, please see the professor.

### Students with disabilities

Rutgers University welcomes students with disabilities into all of the 
University's educational programs. In order to receive consideration for 
reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact the 
appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially 
enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: 
[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines](https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/documentation-guidelines).  

If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your 
campusâ€™s disability services office will provide you with a Letter of 
Accommodations. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the 
accommodations with them as early in your courses as possible. To begin this 
process, please complete the Registration form on the ODS web site at: 
[https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration-form](https://ods.rutgers.edu/students/registration-form).
