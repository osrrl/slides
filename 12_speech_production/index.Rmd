# 4 phases of speech production

.big[
- Respiration

- Phonation

- Resonance

- Articulation
]

---

# Respiration

.big[
- It's just breathing

- The power supply of speech

- 2 types: 

    - Inhalation: air is pulled into the lungs by contracting the diaphragm

    - Exhalation: air is pushed out of the lungs by relaxing the diaphragm

# Phonation

.big[
- Air is pushed out of the lungs

- Passes through the glottis (the space between the vocal folds)

- Rapid air movement causes vibration of the vocal folds

- The vibrating vocal folds produce voice sounds and control...

    - Pitch: the frequency (F0) at which the vocal folds vibrate

    - Loudness: the intensity (dB) of the sound

    - Quality: sound quality (timbre) of the voice (voiceless, breathy, modal, creaky, etc.)

---

# Resonance

.big[
- Process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre/intensity

- Enhancement is created when sound passes through air-filled cavities 

    - pharynx
    - nasopharynx
    - nasal cavity
    - oral cavity

- We can manipulate the resonance chambers to produce different timbre/intensity

---

# Articulation

.big[
- The phonated voice is manipulated by the articulators creating distinct sounds 
- The sounds are then arranged into comprehensible words
- The articulators can be passive or active
    - Lips
    - Teeth
    - Alveolar Ridge
    - Hard Palate
    - Soft Palate (also called the velum)
    - Tongue
    - Mandible
    - Uvula 
    - Epiglottis

# Research methods in speech production

### Common

.big[
- Shadowing/delayed repetition

- Reading

- Picture naming
]

Problem: lab speech

--

Bigger problem: reduced speech

# Reduced speech

.pull-left[

.big[
- We typically shorten speech by eliding segments, syllables, reducing vowel quality, etc. 

- To truly understand speech production (and perception) we need to study normal (reduced) speech

- Dr. Natasha Warner to the rescue

# Eliciting reduced speech

### Phone-a-friend technique

- Purpose: elicit natural, spontaneous speech in the lab

# The participant calls a close friend of family member

# They are instructed to talk for 10-15 minutes

# Can (and do) talk about anything they want

---
class: title-slide-section-grey, middle

# **Pros**  

## Results in beautiful reduced speech (like the examples on Dr. Warner's website)

## Almost completely removes concerns about "lab speech"

--

# **Cons**  

## Trade off with experimental control 

## Unwanted personal information?

# Getting help

## If you have problems with github 
## ask for help on slack

### You can find some very basic tutorials related to 
### R, RStudio, RMarkdown, GitHub, and Slack [here][here]
