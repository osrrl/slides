# Literate programming

.pull-left[

- This means we write code in a way that clearly documents 
what we did.

- Instead of writing code with the purpose of telling the 
computer what to do, we write code that tells other humans 
what we told the computer to do and *why*. 

- Importantly, we don't separate our code from the report/essay/manuscript
we are writing. Everyting is together, in a single document.
