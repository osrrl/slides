# Writing reproducible scientific reports with papaja

---

# papaja

### Overview

- When publishing you have to adhere to the standards of the journal

- This is a pain in the neck

- Journals in Psychology use APA format and accept LaTeX, PDF, word, 
and other file formats

- Most journals in linguistics accept (require) APA format and usually 
only .docx (word) files (i.e., SSLA)

- If you ~~hate~~ dislike word this is annoying

---

# papaja

### What is papaja?

- An R package that formats documents (pdf, .docx) in APA format
- Basically it provides a template and helper functions for academic 
writing
- It also provides templates for revision response letters

### Purpose?

- Simplify paper formatting
- The idea is that you don't have to worry about the little things 
so you can 'just write'
- Because it uses RMarkdown you can integrate r code and create 
reproducible reports

---

# papaja

### Why should I use it?

- Obvious benefits of using RMarkdown (reproducibility, flexibility, integration with github)
- Fast, easy
- Pandoc citations
  1. Create a .bib file with references (more on this later)
  2. Automatically generate references section in APA format
- Pre-prints

--

### How does it work?

- Install papaja
- Open new template
- Write and knit
- If you know RMarkdown, you know papaja

# A simple example

---
background-image: url(./assets/img/papaja_1.png)
background-size: 400px
background-position: 99% 50%

# Exercise I 

- If you haven't already, install `papaja`:  
`remotes::install_github("crsh/papaja")`
- (Probably not necessary but...) restart RStudio
--

- Click the new file icon (white square with a green ".green[+]")
- Select `R Markdown...` > `From template` > `APA article (6th edition)`
- A template will open automatically. Inspect the file.  
What is familiar? What is different?
--

- Save the file in `manuscript` and click "Knit" (probably get an error)
--

- Look for this section of the YAML front matter...  

```
documentclass     : "apa6"
classoption       : "man"
output            : papaja::apa6_word
---
```

- change **papaja::apa6_pdf** to .green[papaja::apa6_word] and knit

--

.pull-left[

- Make changes to the text and re-Knit
- Add r chunks 
  1. with simple math (i.e., 2 + 2) 
  2. with a plot using `ggplot2`

]

--

.pull-right[
</br>
- Open and inspect the .bib file
- Try to cite it in the text and re-Knit

]

# An advanced example

---

# Child and parent documents

- Go to https://github.com/jvcasillas/dpbe_l2_replication

- Inspect the `docs` folder, then the `manuscript` folder

--

- Click on `master.Rmd` and inspect the body of the document. How is it 
different from what we have already seen?

--

- Go back and open the directory `includes`. Inspect the contents. 

--

- Specifically, navigate to the `sections` directory. Open some of the files. 

--

#### **Take away**: you can use 'child documents' to break up a large manuscript

- the 'parent' or master document calls the child documents
- the output is the same... a single word/pdf/html document
- works well with dissertations (each child is a chapter)
- useful when distractions are an issue

# More about knitr

---

# Exercise II

### knitr

- Go back to the `papaja` document we created before
- Create knitr code chunks and try the following commands (in different chunks). **Remember** you should always name your chunks!


.pull-left[
Commands

- `echo`: logical (TRUE/FALSE)
- `eval`: logical (TRUE/FALSE)
- `results`: character ('hide', 'asis', etc.)
- figure options
  - `fig.retina`: numeric (1 or 2)
  - `fig.width`: numeric
  - `fig.height`: numeric
  - `fig.align`: character ('left', 'right', 'center')
]

--
<br><br>
.pull-right[
- hide/show code
- evaluate/ignore code
- format for code output
- figure ouptions
  - normal or hi-def images
  - figure width in inches
  - figure height in inches
  - alignment of figure (most useful in html files)
]
