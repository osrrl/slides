### Meta-analysis

.pull-left[

- Statistical approach 

- Aggregation of results from many studies 

- Inferences based on larger and potentially more diverse samples

- Attempt to increase power (over individual studies)

- Improve estimates of the size of the effect

- Resolve uncertainty when reports disagree

- Promotes collaboration among scientists, and incentivizes more 
systematic research programs

# Attempts at reform

### Meta-analysis

- Cannot fix problems of p-hacking, reporting errors, and fraud

- Some researchers believe it dramatically exacerbates them

- May increase type I error

- Researcher is "further" from data, difficult to judge quality (especially when attempting to include unpublished studies)

- The popularity of meta-analysis has served to emphasize the size of 
effects and by thus raising the consciousness of behavioral scientists has promoted the cause of power analysis

- If we didn't have the problems we currently have, this approach would be 
more productive
--
... we will see more meta-analyses in the future

# What is a registered report? &lt;/br&gt;What is it designed to do?

---

# Attempts at reform

### Registered reports

- Publish your experimental design first

- Receive open peer review based of the theoretical grounds 
and methods

- Reviewers suggest amendments that can still be incorporated before 
  the study is run

- The peer review process grants In Principle Acceptance (IPA)

- Only then carry out the experiment, analyze data, finish manuscript

- Resubmit for second peer review

- Publish results, regardless of the outcome

- Goal: reduce the number of papers reporting statistically significant results that are actually false positives

# New publishing pipeline

# Attempts at reform

### Unreviewed pre-registration

- A second type of pre-registration, 

- Does not involve reviewers before data collection

- Authors write plan and it is time-stamped before conducting the study 

- In theory the process is similar to the standard model, but one can be 
(more) confident that there is no HARKing/p-hacking 

- Two models (registered report vs. unreviewed pre-registration) are not 
mutually exclusive

- They can have different priorities in the research cycle (i.e., 
exploratory vs. confirmatory research)

# Attempts at reform

### Pre-registration

#### Negatives

- More work?

- Too restrictive?

- Idea theft?

#### Limitations

- Flexibility (sometimes we think of things pos facto)?

- Fraud (multiple pre-registrations?)?

- Irrelevant for certain types of research?

---

# Attempts at reform

### Registered reports

#### How? Online platforms for pre-registration 

- the Open Science Framework (OSF)

### What does it mean for the field?

- Researchers have to adapt, learn new methods of open science
- Journals have to adapt, adjust model of publishing

--

### What does it mean for you?

- Registered dissertation experiments?
- Published replications before graduation?
- Increased knowledge of coding?
- Increased sharing of materials (code, data, stimuli)?

&lt;ru-blockquote&gt;
That said, I have two main reservations about the manuscript. First, the potential value of this manuscript to serve as a fully-worked-out example of GAMMs or Bayesian analysis is limited by the unavailability of the raw data and R code. I actually think the primary value of this manuscript is its demonstration of these statistical techniques, and so if the authors are unable or unwilling to make their raw data and R code available, I cannot recommend this manuscript for publication.

# What is markdown?

- Markdown is a language used to format text

- Rather than click a button to format (like in word), you use markdown 
syntax

- Lightweight markup language (like HTML but simple)

- Easy to read and write because it uses simple tags (e.g. #)

--

.pull-left[

```
# This is a subsection header

This is **bold** text.  
This is *italic* text. 

- This is 
- a list

1. This is a 
2. numbered list

# Exercise I

- Open RStudio
- File &gt; New file &gt; RMarkdown (then click "ok")
- Select all (cmd + a) and delete everthing
- Type "hello world"
- Click "knit" (You will be asked to save. Save the file to your desktop)
--

- Try to add the following: 
  - a section header
  - bold text
  - an ordered list
  - an unordered list
  - a link to your favorite website

# Exercise II 

- Open RStudio
- File &gt; New file &gt; RMarkdown (then click "ok")
- Take a look at the text. What markup do you see?
- Click "knit" (You will be asked to save. Save the file to your desktop)
- What do you see? What section represents the `front matter`? How can you distinguish plain markdown text from r code?
--

- Create a new `knitr` code chunk, add the following and click `knit`:  
`x &lt;- 5; 2 * x`
--

- Create a new `knitr` code chunk and add the following (note: you may have to install the package):  

.pull-left[

  ggplot(aes(x = drat, y = mpg)) + 
    geom_point() +

# Why use it?

### An RMardown file is a **dynamic document** that is fully reproducible 

### It can be regenerated automatically whenever the R code or data changes

### It allows you to easily share your results

# Exercise III

- Open the github desktop app
- You should still have the `github_practice` repo
- Pull in the newest changes (click 'pull')
- **If you don't have the `github_practice` repo, go to github.com, 
search for `jvcasillas`, search for the `github_practice` repo, 
fork it again, and clone it to your desktop**. 
--

- Open the `rmarkdown_ex` folder and double click "rmarkdown_ex.Rproj"
--

- Find the "Files" tab in one of the 4 window panes, click on `ex3.Rmd` 
- Inspect the file, notice the front matter and the code chunks. 
- Click 'knit'
--

- Change the front matter from what you see on the left to what you see on 
the right and click `knit`:
