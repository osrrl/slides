# Workflows and projects

### What does your workflow currently look like?

### What do you organize for? 

### How do you do it? 

### Where do your files live?

---

# RStudio projects

### If your projects include R scripts, RMarkdown documents, HTML slides, etc., you should be using RStudio projects

--

- What are they?  

--

.content-box-blue[
`.rproj` files create an independent RStudio environment that limits the scope of your R session to the project in question.
]

--

- Why use them?  

--

  - They simplify organizing projects
  - They integrate well with github
  - They promote a project-oriented workflow

  - .red[Bad]: `Experiment`
  - .green[Good]: `qualifying_paper_1`

- no capitals, no spaces (use `_` or `-`)
  - .red[Bad]: `Experiment for syntax class`
  - .green[Good]: `semantic_predictability_exp_1`

- no non-standard characters
  - .red[Bad]: `Analysis of ð for ICPhS 2019`
  - .green[Good]: `spirantization_icphs_2019`

# Tips and tricks

### Nested projects

- You can have RStudio projects inside of larger projects
- Only the larger project is a repo
- Ex.  
  - Project: `dissertation` (← repo)
  - Nested project: `production_semantic_processing_las`
  - Nested project: `prod_perc_bilabials_jphon`

### Alfred

- Productivity app 
- Only on Mac (I think), free
- Works like Spotlight search, but customizable
- Set to search for `.rproj` files
- Allows you to quickly open and close RStudio projects
