# 2AFC

- Two alternative forced choice
- Also known as `identification` or `classification`
- A stimuli is presented (normally audio)
- The stimuli is classified/identified as one of two options

### If you finished consider the following questions

- Can we produce a sound ([ba], for example) several times in exactly the same 
way? Why or why not?
- What are the consequences of your answer with regard to speech perception?

# English vs. Spanish

### The /t/ in Spanish is different from the /t/ in English in **PoA** and VOT

<p></p>

- Place of articulation: Where is the contact produced?
  - Spanish /t/ is dental 
  - English /t/ is alveolar

---

# English vs. Spanish

### The /t/ in Spanish is different from the /t/ in English in PoA and **VOT**

<p></p>

- **VOT** (voice-onset time): the duration (in ms) between the stop burst and 
the onset of modal voicing
  - It results from the coordination of articulatory gestures (the release and 
  the vibration of the vocal folds)
  - VOT can be negative (lead) or positive (lag), it is used in voice timing 
  (voiced vs. voiceless sounds)

---

# VOT

<div style="float:right">
  <img width="50" src="./assets/img/fill.png">
  <img src="./assets/img/confundido.png">
</div>

- Spanish and English contrast /**p t k**/ and /<BLUE>b d g</BLUE>/ 
- The phonetic realizations are different
  - Spanish: /d/ has lead VOT y /t/ has short-lag VOT
  - English: /d/ has short-lag VOT and /t/ has long-lag (aspirated) VOT

# Speech perception

- How do we differentiate between speech and noise?

- How do we extract relevant information from a poor signal?

---

# The lack of invariance problem

- Speech sounds are never pronounced in exactly the same way (acoustically)

- If I say `taco` [ˈta.ko] 10x, is will never be the same (physically, acoustically)

- How are we able to relate the sound with abstract categories (phonemes)?

---

# Categorical perception

- "Equal sized physical differences are not equal sized psychologically."

- We don't perceive a phoneme continuum as being continuous...

- Within category acoustic differences are minimized (perceptually)

- Between category differences are salient

# Categorical perception

- How do we study categorical perception?
  - 2AFC (identification)
  - AX (discrimination)

# Categorical perception

### Pallier et al. (1997)

- Early sequential bilinguals Bilingües: Spanish/Catalan, Catalan/Spanish

- Catalan has mid-vowel contrasts that don't exist in Spanish (/e/-/ɛ/)

# Categorical perception

### Pallier et al. (1997)

- Early sequential bilinguals: Spanish/Catalan, Catalan/Spanish

- Catalan has mid-vowel contrasts that don't exist in Spanish (/e/-/ɛ/)

- Identification (2AFC)
    - "Did you hear [ˈ**pe**.**ɾa**] (Peter) or [ˈ<BLUE>pɛ</BLUE>.<BLUE>ɾa</BLUE>] (pera)?"
- Discrimination
    - "Are these sounds the same or different?"

# Categorical perception

### Pallier et al. (1997)

- Conclusion
  - Early sequential Spanish/Catalan bilinguals don't perceive the Catalan 
  /e/-/ɛ/ mid-vowel contrast categorically
  - Early exposure is not enough...
