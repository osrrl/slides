# What gives?

.pull-left[
.big[
- In the programming world committing to master is a nono. Why?

- Most developers use git as version control for software

- The .blue[master branch] is usually left for public releases

- As such it should always work

# What's the problem

.pull-left[
.big[
- You might break something

- You might get complicated merge conflicts
]

.full-width[.content-box-blue[
Person A is working on the same file as Person B, they both make changes 
and Person A tries to submit a pull request to master on a file that is 
different from when (s)he started

# What's the solution?

### Branches

- Using branches gives us a way to work on different versions of a repository 
at one time

--

- By default a new repo has one branch called .large[.blue[master]] 

--

- Master is *the definitive* branch 

--

- We create new branches to experiment, make edits, create new features, etc., 
before committing them to master

--

- When you create a branch off of master youâ€™re essentially making a copy, or 
snapshot of master at a specific point in time (like making a copy of 
a word file, i.e., `essay_final_version3_for_real.docx`)

--

- A branch should be used for making 'one logical change', usually to add a 
feature in software development

--

- If a collaborator makes changes to master while you are working on a branch, 
you can pull in those changes

# Yeah, but... academic writing is different

.big[
- Using branches in many cases may be overkill, depending on what your working 
on, i.e., slides for class
]

--

<p></p>

.big[
- But there are concrete examples where it makes sense to use branches...
  - when collaborating with others
  - when working on large projects
  - when making revisions to a manuscript
  - when making changes to your website, cv, conference presentation/poster
  - whenever breaking something small will have a large impact on the project
  - whenever the possibility of "going back" needs to be controlled and 
  easily achieved

# Summary - workflows

### Old way

- Working solo: commit/push to master 

--
(.red[medium danger])

--
- Working as collaborator: commit/push to master 

--
(.red[danger]!)

--
- Working as outside collaborator: fork, commit/push to remote,  
pull request to master 

--
(.red[low danger])

--

background-position: 97% 50%

### Better way

- Working solo: branch, commit/push, pull request
--

- Working as collaborator, branch, commit/push, pull request
--

- Working as outside collaborator: fork, branch, commit/push, pull request

# Getting help

## If you have problems with github 
## ask for help on slack

### You can find some very basic tutorials related to 
### R, RStudio, RMarkdown, GitHub, and Slack [here][here]
