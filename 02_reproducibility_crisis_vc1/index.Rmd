# Reproducibility crisis in Psychological science

### What is the Open Science Collaboration?

### What is the reproducibility crisis?

--

- 100 prominent papers analyzed, only 39% could be replicated

> "Scientists and journal editors are biased--consciously or not--in  
> what they publish"

--

### What exactly is the concern? 

--

- Type I error

# Reproducibility crisis in Psychological science

### Is it all type I error? (probably not)

### p-hacking

> refers to the many different decisions that researchers make during data 
> collection, preparation, and analyses that maximize the chance of obtaining 
> significant effects

- p-hacking is a logical explanation for why we consistently see 
underpowered studies that are statistically significant

- p-hacking can turn any false hypothesis into one that has statistically significant support

- "researcher degrees of freedom"

- not necessarily done to be deceptive or manipulative

---

# Reproducibility crisis in Psychological science

### Examples of p-hacking (from Le, 2018)

- Collect data and doing exploratory analyses during data collection. If results are significant, stop collecting data; if not, continue until it becomes significant.

- Collect data on several DVs, but only report results from the DVs that show significant effects. Similarly, create DVs in different ways (e.g., a subset of items) to maximize significant effects.

- Running multiple tests and only reporting on those that yielded significant results.

- If initial results do not show significant effects, re-run analyses with control variables or interaction terms, or doing subgroups analyses.

- Eliminating data (e.g., “outliers” or particular demographic groups) in an attempt to find stronger results.

- Designing an experiment with multiple conditions, but ignoring or collapsing conditions if analyses based on all conditions is not significant.

- Run multiple experiments and only report those that “worked.”

---

# Reproducibility crisis in Psychological science

### Harking

- "hypothesizing after results are known" 

- collect data 

- do a wide range of exploratory analyses

- "cherry pick" from those results and (mis)represent those as being derived from a priori hypotheses. 

- This is also known as “data dredging” and “fishing” 

- May seem surprising that this practice occurs, but is rather common and has even been recommended as the preferred way to frame a research project (e.g., Bem, 2002).

# So what?

### Is psychology doomed? What does this mean for linguistics?

--

### What if your paper does not replicate? What does this mean for the authors?

--

> Boldness in Conjecture, Austerity in Refutation  
> 
> \- Karl Popper (*The Logic of Scientific Discovery*, 1935)

--

- Make risky predictions (boldness in conjecture) and then try to severely kill/disprove your theory (austerity in refutation)
- Science cannot progress as long as you play it safe

--

### What is direct replication? Are there other types of replications?

# Exercise II

### Cloning

- Clone the github_practice repo on to your computer

- Add a folder whose name is your last name (e.g. 'casillas') 
- Create a README.md file using a text editor and put your   
favorite link in the body
- Save everything, commit the changes with an informative message
- Push changes to your cloned repo
- Check github to see if it worked

--
- Submit pull request
- When everybody has finished, fetch changes

# Getting help

## If you have problems using github 
## ask for help in the slack channel

### You can find some very basic tutorials related to 
### R, RStudio, RMarkdown, GitHub, and Slack [here][here]
